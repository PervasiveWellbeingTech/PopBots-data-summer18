# PopBots-data-summer18
Data collected during summer 2018

During the summer of 2018, the Pervasive Wellbeing Technology Lab used Amazon Mechanical Turk (using Qualtrics surveys) to gather linguistic and demographic data on people and what commonly stresses them out. The main focus of this data is the pairing of stressors (i.e. an individual's written statement about something that stresses them out) and their responses (i.e. a text response, like what one would receive via text message from a friend, to the stressor). The goal is to understand what kind of responses, or affirmations, are appropriate for different situations. The study consists of 3 separate surveys, whose main purposes are detailed below:

  Phase 1. Collect stressors and “ideal” responses to them. (i.e. What’s something that has been stressing you out recently? What would an ideal response from a bot/friend look like?)
  
  Phase 2. Collect alternate responses to selected stressors from part 1. (i.e. Imagine your friend texts you: “I’m stressed because I don’t have enough money for next month’s rent.” How do you respond?)
  
  Phase 3. Have people rank and categorize (good, bad, neutral) multiple responses (selected responses from part 2. + “ideal” response from part 1.), given a stressor. To make sure people are putting thought into their responses, require them to provide justifications for how they determined if statements were good/bad/neutral, and maybe have them “fix” the responses they categorized as bad.

Data from the 3 phases are contained in this repo:

We also have data from user conversations via Facebook Messenger, when we were still using the Messenger platform. We were able to perform some analyses on this data, but for privacy purposes, we cannot share user conversation data on github.
